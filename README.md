Swift iOS CoreML Image Classifier

This app uses 4 top [CoreML Machine Learning classifiers](https://developer.apple.com/machine-learning/) in parallel, to come up with labels for images:
* MobileNet (17.1 MB)
* ResNet50 (102.6 MB)
* Inception v3 (94.7 MB)
* VGG16 (553.5 MB)

All 4 of these models "[detect] the dominant objects present in an image from a set of 1000 categories such as trees, animals, food, vehicles, people, and more."
